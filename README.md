# Doctors Appointment

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive Healthcare Management System built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It provides a RESTful API for managing users, doctors, appointments, and related healthcare services. The system supports three main user roles: **Admin, Doctor, and Patient**, each with specific permissions and functionalities.

## üîê User Registration & Roles
### üë§ Default User Role: Patient
- All new users who sign up are automatically registered as patients.
- Only admins can upgrade a patient to a doctor by filling in:
  - **Specialty** (e.g., "Cardiology", "Neurology")
  - **Qualifications** (e.g., "MD, PhD")
  - **Profile Image** (optional)

## Key Features

### User Management
- **Registration & Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with JWT.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Three user roles (Admin, Doctor, Patient).
- **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profiles.
- **Admin Functions**: User upgrades, deletions, and management.

### Doctor Functionality
- **Profile Management**: Upload profile image by drag and drop.
- **Availability Scheduling**: Set available time slots for appointments.
- **Appointment Management**: View, confirm, or reject patient appointments.
- **Patient Communication**: Automated email notifications for status changes.

### Patient Functionality

## üìä Dashboards Overview

### üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Doctor Dashboard
- Set availability (Choose time slots).

### Patient-to-Doctor Transition Workflow
To understand how the system works, follow these steps:
1. **Sign up two users** (both will be **patients** by default).
2. **Login as an Admin** (credentials provided below) and **upgrade one patient to a doctor**.
3. **The upgraded user will receive an email** with a login URL to the **Doctor Dashboard**.
4. **Login as the doctor**, upload a **profile image**, and **set availability**.
5. **Logout and log in as the second user (patient)**.
6. **Book an appointment** with the newly upgraded doctor.
7. **Check your email** for confirmation of your appointment request.
8. **Login as the doctor** and either confirm or reject the appointment.
9. **The patient will receive an email notification** about the status update.
